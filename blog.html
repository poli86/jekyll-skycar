			<h3>Seat Cleaning and Stain Removal</h3>
		</header>
		<section class="blog-content read-more">
			<!-- <p>Yesterday Revolution Auto Salon took on one of the most stained seats we had ever seen. The client worked in the construction industry out of Elliot, Maine, doing drywall installations and was always carting around his materials and tools. Inevitably, this led to excessive staining. See below for the comparison shot! Also, stay tuned for the video of us removing the staining!</p> -->

			<h3>Microfiber compound and polish pads - brief product review</h3>
		</header>
		<section class="blog-content read-more">
			<!-- <p>SkyCar  just started using the microfiber compound and polish pads we got from Meguiars to do our paint corrections prior to cars being coated with a wax, sealant, ceramic coating ( CeramicPro - Gyeon - CQuartz - OptiCoat - Kenzo ) or paint protection film ( rock chip film by XPel, Suntek & Premium Shield).  To describe the compound and polish abilities of these things in two words: "holy shit!” These things are amazing. We still hold true to our foam pads when we are doing our final polish step(s), but the microfiber pads polish down really well and aren’t clogged up by clearcoat and polish as often.</p> -->

			<!-- <p>SkyCar Auto Salon has redefined the image of your typical auto detailer, to a professional level detailing company and ceramic coating installer. When Revolution Auto Salon was established, we were cleaning cars and protecting paint just like everyone else, with a typical premium sealant or wax.Never in our wildest dreams did we think that there could be a product that offered better paint protection, more gloss, and made maintenance a breeze.</p> -->
