	<h2><strong>What is Ceramic Coating?</strong></h2>
	<p>Ceramic Coating is a multi-layerable, clear, liquid nano ceramic that when cured, will transform itself on the surface to a permanent, ridgid, flexible glass shield. Ceramic Coating can be described as an additional clear coat, with 3 times the hardness and self cleaning properties. It can be applied to the Paint, Wheels, Glass, Plastic, Leather, Upholstery, and much more.</p>

			<h4>GOOD INVESTMENT</h4>
			<p>Ceramic Coating will protect the vehicles exterior and interior from deteriorating for a lifetime. The resale market value will therefore be substantially higher! Any surface scratches that happen in the coating are easily removed with light polishing which will not weaken the integrity of the original clear coat. With Ceramic  Coating your paint won’t fade or age due to the UV protection in the glass coating.</p>

			<h4>LOOKING NEW ALL THE TIME</h4>
			<p>Once the coating is applied you will see a mirror effect, glossiness and color depth, incomparable to anything else! With proper maintenance your car’s finish will shine for many years to come. Ceramic Coating once cured, is measured to have hardness above 9H. Normal clear coat has hardness between 2H and 4H. The glass shield prevents minor scratches to your clearcoat and acts as a sacrificial layer. This preserves the original factory paint.</p>

			<h4>LESS MAINTENANCE</h4>
			<p>WThe slickness of the coated surface doesn’t allow dirt, break dust and tar to stick to your car’s paint, wheels or glass. This makes washing your vehicle less labor intensive and less frequent. Waxing is now obsolete. This nano technology allows the Ceramic nanoparticles to fill the smallest pores in the paint which makes the Ceramic Coating glass shield shiny, smooth and extremely slick or hydrophobic. Ceramic Coating dramatically lowers the surface tension preventing environmental contaminants from bonding to the surface.</p>
